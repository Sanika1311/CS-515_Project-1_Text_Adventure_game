I spent approximately 15 hours on the project. 

Question : A description of how you tested your code.
I wrote doctest for some of the functions to check where is the error. My error inputs consisted of verbs different from the verbs given in the  specs. Also tested the .map file input to check if the map is valid or not.  

Question : Any bugs or issues you could not resolve.


Question : An example of a difficult issue or bug and how you resolved.

Question : A list of the three extensions youâ€™ve chosen to implement, with appropriate detail on them for the CAs to evaluate them (i.e., what are the new verbs/features, how do you exercise them, where are they in the map).
